## Quick start
`pip install doorpost_detector`

OR

- `git clone <repo-link>`
- `cd <repo-dir>`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `pip install -e .`


## To obtain doorpost poses from cropped pointcloud
```python
import doorpost_detector.api as dpd

response = dpd.doorpost_pose_from_cropped_pointcloud_usecase(points)

```


## To obtain doorpost poses from pointcloud and estimated door location
```python
import doorpost_detector.api as dpd

response = dpd.doorpost_pose_from_pointcloud_and_door_location_estimate_usecase(points, door_location)

```


## Response format
```python
@dataclass
class Response:
    success: bool
    poses: tuple[float, float, float, float] # x1,y1,x2,y2
    certainty: tuple[float, float]
```
